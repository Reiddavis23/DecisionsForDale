    <p>
      Dale was an old man in his early 90's.  He was at the point in his life where he experienced quite a quiet existence.
      He did not have very many friends outside of his small Vermont cottage, other than his home health aide who visited him
      every morning from 8 AM - 11 PM.  In time, his loneliness grew to wear on his soul.  He knew he had to do something to
      feel alive again.

    Suddenly one day, while reading the local newspaper, he came across an ad for a newly formed dancing club for seniors.  Sure,
    there was a bit of a cost, but Dale nonetheless began to consider attending the club as a way to finally begin interacting with others once again.
