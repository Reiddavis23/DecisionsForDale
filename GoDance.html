    <p>
    Dale thinks to himself " Why not.  You only live once.  The first meeting is Thursday.  I'm going to check it out"
    </p>
    <p>
    The next Thursday, Dale heads to the local senior club, signs the sign-in sheet, and walks in to the dancing club meeting.

    As soon as he walks in, he sees two people he immediately recognizes from his past.
    His long lost friend Abraham, and his high school sweetheart, Ruby.

    Dale only has a few minutes to approach one of his old acquaintances before the dancing lesson begins.
