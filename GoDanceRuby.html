    "Ruby is that you?"... Dale faintly whispers as he approaches Ruby from behind.
    </p>
    <p>
    Ruby turns around... "Dale Johnson, I can't believe it! I never thought I'd see you again."
    </p>
    <p>
    Dale says to Ruby... "Wow, you are as beautiful as the day I met you."

    "Oh Dale, you've always been the charmer!" Ruby responds, clearly blushing.
        </p>
  <p>
    "Ruby, I would love to be your dance partner for the evening, in the event that you don't have one already." Dale says back.
        </p>
  <p>
        "That would be more than delightful." says Ruby proudly.
