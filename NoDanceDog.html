    <h1><center>Faced With A Decision</center> </h1>
    <p>
    "A new pet would a great idea!" Dale thought.  Dale leaped into his hatchback and drove 1.5 miles away to the animal shelter from the advertisement.
    </p>
    <p>
    As soon as he got to the cages, he saw the dog he knew he'd love.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What's her name" Dale asked the shelter worker.  "Her name is Bessie" she responded.
    </p>

    <p>
      "I'll take her!" Dale said with excitement.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dale filled out the necessary paperwork and took Bessie home with him the same day.
    </p>
    <p>
    Since then, Dale has made sure to spend every waking moment with Bessie.  They do everything together, from playing frisbee in the park, to quiet walks through the neighborhood.
    </p>
    <p>
    In the evenings, Bessie lays across Dale's lap as he reads the daily newspaper.
