    <h1><center>Decisions For Dale</center> </h1>
    <p>
    Dale says to himself "At my age, dancing is not the best idea. I could get seriously hurt!"
    </p>
    <p>
    "There must be another way to keep myself occupied" he thought.
    </p>
    <p>
      As he turned the page, he saw another ad that caught his attention.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a classified ad that read "VISIT YOUR LOCAL ANIMAL SHELTER AND ADOPT A PET TODAY"
    </p>
    <p>
      Adjacent to this ad, he sees another post that reads "SPARE ROBOT PARTS FOR SALE AT LOCAL SCRAP YARD"
    </p>
    <p>
      Dale thinks to himself "Wow, both of these ads are intriguing... which one should I pursue?"
    </p>
